"""
    printmatrix(mat [, Val(F), colnames])

Display a matrix in full while controlling the formatting of each value and
optionally showing the column names.
  * `Val(F)` - display each number in the given format `F`. The format is in the
    form of a decimal point number where the whole part indicates the total
    width and the fractional part is the number of digits printed after the
    decimal point. Default is `Val(12.7)`
  * `colnames` - a list of names to display in the first row. The names are
    displayed as given, possibly with padding to match the width given in the
    `Val` argument. If any names are longer than that, they will not be
    truncated and so the display will not be aligned properly. Sorry about that!
